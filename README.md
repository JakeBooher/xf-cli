# xf-cli

Basic XenForo CLI utility to make running the commands a bit more natural.

## How to use
1. Download the [shell script](https://github.com/JakeBooher/xf-cli/blob/master/xenforo) for Linux or MacOS or [batch script](https://github.com/JakeBooher/xf-cli/blob/master/xenforo.bat) for Windows
2. Place the script in your /usr/local/bin directory (for Linux or MacOS), or add its location to your $PATH environment variable on Windows
3. Run any XenForo CLI command just as you normally would have, but instead of typing `php cmd.php` you'll only need to use `xenforo` (or `xenforo.bat` on Windows) followed by the necessary arguments

Feel free to submit Pull Requests or issues with ideas that could improve this utility!
